- Use strict null checks to prevent null pointer exceptions or undefined errors
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Utilize type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Implement proper type inference to reduce type annotations
- Utilize enums for a set of named constants
- Avoid using `any` and create necessary types for better type safety
- Use readonly properties and the `as const` assertion for immutability
