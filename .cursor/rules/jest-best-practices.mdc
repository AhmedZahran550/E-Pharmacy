- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for unit tests
- Write unit tests for each public function in controllers and services
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies, except for inexpensive third-party dependencies
- Write end-to-end tests for each API module
- Add an admin/test method to each controller as a smoke test
- Use clear and descriptive naming for test variables (inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX)
- Write acceptance tests for each module following the Given-When-Then convention
